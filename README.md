# DALI Data Challenge 22F

## Part 1 Superstore Descriptive Analysis

I use Tableau for data visualization. I analyze sales and profit data from five dimensions and answer the following key questions:

1. Geography: Which state has the highest/lowest sales/profit ratio? 
2. Product: Which product categories have the highest sales/profit ratios in each segment?
3. Sales Forecast: What are the sales in the next year?
4. Shipping Day: What is the gap from order date to shipping date within each product category?
5. Customer: Who are the most valuable customers with highest sales/profit? Who are the key customers that drive the lost?


## Part 2 Exploratory Data Analysis + Modeling

I use Python for exploratory data analysis and modeling

1. statistical data analysis
2. time series forecasting for sales - ARIMA model
3. Future work: feature engineering and machine learning models for sales forecasting
